🤖 POOLING DETECTION RESULTS
================================================================================

📈 TRANSACTION PATTERN ANALYSIS:
   Circular trades detected: 162
     • 2-node cycles: 16 (Less suspicious - could be simple buy/sell)
     • 3-node cycles: 24 (Moderately suspicious - suggests coordination)
     • 4+-node cycles: 39 (Highly suspicious - complex wash trading)
     • 5+-node cycles: 49 (Highly suspicious - complex wash trading)
     • 6+-node cycles: 34 (Highly suspicious - complex wash trading)
   Rapid back-and-forth trades: 10
   Suspicious address pairs: 26
   Clustered amounts: 2

⏰ TIME ANOMALY ANALYSIS:
   Time anomalies detected: 82
   Justification: Anomalies detected when transactions show unusual timing patterns
   that deviate from normal trading behavior, suggesting coordinated activity

🌐 NETWORK ANALYSIS:
   Nodes: 110
   Edges: 165
   Communities: 14
   Network centralization: 2.452
   Justification: High centralization suggests few addresses control most flow

📊 VOLUME ANALYSIS:
   Anomalous time periods: 0
   Total time periods analyzed: 17
   Justification: Volume spikes indicate coordinated trading activity

⚠️  RISK ASSESSMENT:
   Overall Risk Score: 89/100
   🚨 HIGH RISK: Strong evidence of artificial pooling/wash trading
   Multiple suspicious patterns detected across different analysis dimensions
